# GoExpertPostGrad

A specialised repository dedicated to Advanced Development in Golang, mirroring the projects and learning experiences
from the Lato Sensu Post-Graduation course in Advanced Development in Golang - Go Expert.

## Description

GoExpertPostGrad is an expansive compilation of academic projects, practical assignments, and theoretical learning from
the Lato Sensu post-graduation course in Advanced Development in Golang - Go Expert. This course is a collaboration
between Full Cycle, an institution renowned for its technical excellence, led by the esteemed Wesley Willians, and
Faculdade Bras√≠lia - FBr, a prestigious institution of higher learning in Brazil. This repository serves as a practical
representation of the course's advanced Golang concepts, demonstrating the capabilities of Golang in software
development.

Some highlights of what the course covers:

1. **Foundations**: Exploration of Golang foundations like strong typing, pointers, and package management üèóÔ∏è
2. **API Development**: Development of APIs with a focus on HTTP Server, Mux, Authentication, JWT tokens, and API
   documentation üåê
3. **Concurrency & Multithreading**: Advanced concepts like concurrency, multithreading, and race condition prevention
   üöÄ
4. **Key packages**: Extensive work with important packages, file manipulation, HTTP calls, JSON objects, and more üì¶
5. **Implementations**: Practical implementations like gRPC, GraphQL, AWS S3 file uploads, and RabbitMQ integration üõ†Ô∏è
6. **Clean Architecture**: Introducing clean architecture principles and their application in Golang üèõÔ∏è
7. **Context package**: Understanding the role of context in Golang, including background, timeout, deadline, and
   cancellations ‚è±Ô∏è
8. **Automated testing**: A strong focus on automated testing techniques and tools üß™
9. **Databases**: Detailed study of how Golang interacts with databases and ORM implementation üóÉÔ∏è
10. **Deployment**: Emphasis on deploying applications using Docker and Kubernetes üö¢

** This is a work in progress. The repository will be updated as the course progresses. **
